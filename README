**************dieface daemons ****************
Dieface daemons place a die (think Los Vegas) on earth (longitude, latitude) and 
orient it in 3 dimensional space based on its 6 faces.  Standard Orientation is 1 facing up and 2 facing true-north. That means 6 is facing down and 5 is facing south in Standard Orientation.  
There are 24 possible orientations: 6 faces on a die * 4 possible directions (North South East West).
The daemons expect input from 2 sensors: a gps outputting NMEA sentences, and an accelerometer  with output compatible with the fx0s8700.

CAUTION!!  AS REAL DEAMONS, THESE DEAMONS CREATE/REQUIRE FILES IN
LINUX (NORMALLY RESTRICTED) DIRECTORIES!!!
#  /etc/init.d/S50pmtgpsd, S60pmtfxosd, S70pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/sbin/pmtgpsd, pmtfxosd, pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/share/pmtgeomagnet/WMM.COF
#  /run/pmtgpsd.pid, pmtfxosd.pid,  pmtdiefaced.pid 
#  /dev/shm/pmtgps, pmtfxos, pmtdieface
#  /var/log/syslog
THE DAEMONS RUN WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES!!
REMEMBER TO DELETE APPROPIATE FILES IF/WHEN REMOVING THESE DAEMONS

THESE DAEMONS WILL START AUTOMATICALLY ON BOOTUP!   
IF STARTING MANUALLY, START ORDER = S50pmtgpsd, S60pmtfxosd, S70pmtdiefaced 
IF STOPPING MANUALLY, STOP ORDER = S70pmtdiefaced, S60pmtfxosd, S50pmtgpsd


*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Description *****************************

There are 3 daemons (pmtfxosd, pmtdiefaced, pmtgpsd) 
and 1 display process(displayd)
Each source program has compilation, installation instructions + website info 

pmtfxosd daemon
---------------
creates mmap of /dev/shm/pmtfxos
The Big Loop  
 	puts 1,2,3,4,...(fake data)  
	into struct PMTfxos8700 = yaw, pitch, roll, ecompass
	writes current record into mmapped to /dev/shm/pmtfxos
	defined in fxos8700.h

pmtgpsd daemon
--------------
    puts fixed fake data into
	into struct PMTgps = longitude, latitude, altitude, declination, gmt
	mmapped to /dev/shm/pmtgps
	defined in pmtgps.h
	includes declination calculation NOAA complex


pmtdiefaced
-----------
  reads pitch, roll off PMTfxos8700 in /dev/shm/pmtfxos
    into struct PMTdieEvent	= id, dieface, dieAction
	mmapped to /dev/shm/pmtdieface
	defined in dieface.h 
	converts pitch, roll to dieface roll


ddisplay
--------
    reads current mmapped records via shared memory
	from: /dev/shm/pmtgps  /dev/shm/pmtfxos  /dev/shm/pmtdieface 
	created/updated by daemons pmtfxosd, pmtgpsd, diefaced
	into struct PMTfxos8700
	and displays info on SDL2 screen 



*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Structure *****************************

Structure of pmtfxosd daemon (identical in all 3 daemons):
---------------------------------------------------------
S60pmtfxosd = daemon script in /etc/init.d/... S60 says initiate in boot process
pmtfxosd 	= daemon name as specified in S60pmtfxosd script
			= compiled pmtfxosdaemon.c + fxos8700stub.c
			= daemon in /usr/sbin/

pmtfxosdeamon.c ==> starts daemon process for The Big Loop
fxos8700stub.c ==> creates mmap file, 
				==> writes 1,2,..via struct PMTfxos8700 to mmap
				==> current fxos record to mmap
fxos8700.h ==> struct PMTfxos8700 for fxos8700 record

Each daemon runs independently as a separate process




*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Installation in rootfs ******************

X86: run make in each daemon file.  
BBB: cross compile as per instructions in top lines of src code

THEN
compiled blob: (pmtfxosd, pmtgpsd, pmtdiefaced) ==> /usr/sbin/
start/stop script: (S60pmtfxosd, S50pmtgpsd, S70pmtdiefaced)
	==> /etc/init.d/
generated pid: ( pmtfxosd.pid, pmtgpsd.pid, pmtdiefaced.pid) 
	==> /run  (NO NEED TO INSTALL - FYI ONLY)
WMM.COF (World Magnetic Model data) ==> /usr/share/pmtgeomagnet/WMM.COF
FreeSans.ttf ==> /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf

# INSTALLATION AND TESTING EXAMPLE for pmtfxosd
------------------------------------------------
# sudo cp S60pmtfxosd /etc/init.d/   	## where all daemon scripts stored
# sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd -v  ##S60 = automatically start on boot
# sudo cp pmtfxosd  /usr/sbin/      ## where all daemons are stored
#
#  /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd start  <==> service S60pmtfxosd start
#  service S60pmtfxosd restart  <==>  /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd restart   	
#  service S60pmtfxosd stop    		 
#  service --status-all       
#  ps -ef | grep pmt



*****************************************************************
**************** Running/debugging Daemons ******************


RUNNING FAKE DAEMONS (X86 OR ARM)
----------------------------------
sudo service S50pmtgpsd start
sudo service S60pmtfxosd start
sudo service S70pmtdiefaced start
sudo ./viewsensorX86   OR ./viewsensorARM

NOTE
sudo service S60pmtfxosd start  <==>   sudo /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd start 

DEBUGGING
ps -ef | grep pmt
cat /var/log/syslog | tail
cat /run/pmtfxosd.pid
ls /dev/shm/pmt*  (pmtgps, pmtfxos, pmtdieface)

STOPPING FAKE DAEMONS (X86 OR ARM)
----------------------------------
sudo service S70pmtdiefaced stop
sudo service S60pmtfxosd stop    		 
sudo service S50pmtgpsd stop
Daemons must be started and stopped properly to prevent a crash
 - see RECOVERY FROM A CRASH - 

************************* RECOVERY FROM A CRASH ************************
ps -ef | grep pmt ==> get list of active pmt daemons and kill -9 them
ls /run/pmt*  ==> get list of pmt-.pid files and delete them 
ls /dev/shm/pmt* ==> get list of share-memory files and delete them 



*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Removal from Computer ******************

### Don't forget to remove from /etc/init.d/ /usr/sbin/ for daemon removal ######
#  /etc/init.d/S50pmtgpsd, S60pmtfxosd, S70pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/sbin/pmtgpsd, pmtfxosd, pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/share/pmtgeomagnet/WMM.COF
#  /run/pmtgpsd.pid, pmtfxosd.pid,  pmtdiefaced.pid
