**************dieface daemons ****************
Dieface daemons place a die (think Los Vegas) on earth (longitude, latitude) and 
orient it in 3 dimensional space based on its 6 faces.  Standard Orientation is 1 facing up and 2 facing true-north. That means 6 is facing down and 5 is facing south in Standard Orientation.  
There are 24 possible orientations: 6 faces on a die * 4 possible directions (North South East West).
The daemons expect input from 2 sensors: a gps outputting NMEA sentences, and an accelerometer  with output compatible with the fx0s8700.

CAUTION!!  AS REAL DEAMONS, THESE DEAMONS CREATE/REQUIRE FILES IN
LINUX (NORMALLY RESTRICTED) DIRECTORIES!!!
#  /etc/init.d/S50pmtgpsd, S60pmtfxosd, S70pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/sbin/pmtgpsd, pmtfxosd, pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/share/pmt/WMM.COF, calibdata
#  /run/pmtgpsd.pid, pmtfxosd.pid,  pmtdiefaced.pid 
#  /dev/shm/pmtgps, pmtfxos, pmtdieface
#  /var/log/syslog
THE DAEMONS RUN WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES!!
REMEMBER TO DELETE APPROPIATE FILES IF/WHEN REMOVING THESE DAEMONS

THESE DAEMONS WILL START AUTOMATICALLY ON BOOTUP!   
IF STARTING MANUALLY, START ORDER = S50pmtgpsd, S60pmtfxosd, S70pmtdiefaced 
IF STOPPING MANUALLY, STOP ORDER = S70pmtdiefaced, S60pmtfxosd, S50pmtgpsd


*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Description *****************************

There are 3 daemons (pmtfxosd, pmtdiefaced, pmtgpsd) 
and 2 test processes (testfxosdaemon, testgpsdaemon)
Each source program has compilation instructions 
 for individual testing, and make file for creating deamons.  

pmtfxosd daemon
---------------
    Uses FXO8700 chip magetometer, accelerometer 3+3=6 axis. 
 	puts dieface facing up (1-6), and heading(0-360) 
	into struct PMTfxos (diefaceup, heading).
	PMTfxos is mmapped to /dev/shm/pmtfxos
	defined in pmtfxos.h
    Default if i2c not working: diefaceup=1, heading=0;

pmtgpsd daemon
--------------
    uses LINX chip NMEA Sentences
	Puts struct PMTgps (longitude, latitude, altitude, declination, gmt etc)
	mmapped to /dev/shm/pmtgps
	defined in pmtgps.h
	includes declination calculation NOAA = complex
    Default if LINX chip not working is Percy Lake 
     longlat= 782211W, 451309N, declination=-11.567, 
     date:time=20181031:103005


pmtdiefaced
-----------
  reads diefaceup and converts actions to events
  based on 3 second = steady state. 
    Saves events in struct PMTdieEvent (id, dieface, dieAction)
	mmapped to /dev/shm/pmtdieface
	defined in dieface.h 
	


testfxosdaemon, testgpsdaemon
-----------------------------
    reads current mmapped records in shared memory
	from: /dev/shm/pmtgps  /dev/shm/pmtfxos  /dev/shm/pmtdieface 
	created/updated by daemons pmtfxosd, pmtgpsd, diefaced
	and displays summary information



*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Structure *****************************

Structure of pmtfxosd daemon (similar in all 3 daemons):
---------------------------------------------------------
S60pmtfxosd = daemon script in /etc/init.d/... S60 says initiate in boot process
pmtfxosd 	= daemon name as specified in S60pmtfxosd script
			= compiled pmtfxosdaemon.c + fxos8700stub.c
			= daemon in /usr/sbin/

pmtfxosdeamon.c ==> starts daemon process for The Big Loop
fxos8700run.c ==> creates mmap file, infinite loop updating mmap
fxosdriver.c ==> FXOS8700 chip interface accelerometer, magnetometer data
ecompass.c ==> convert magnetometer data to compass heading
getdieface.c ==> convert accelerometer data to diefaceup reading
fxos8700.h ==> struct PMTfxos for shared memory record

Each daemon runs independently as a separate process




*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Installation in rootfs ******************

Run make in each daemon file...  
OR cross compile as per instructions in top lines of src code

THEN
compiled blob: (pmtfxosd, pmtgpsd, pmtdiefaced) ==> /usr/sbin/
start/stop script: (S60pmtfxosd, S50pmtgpsd, S70pmtdiefaced)
	==> /etc/init.d/
generated pid: ( pmtfxosd.pid, pmtgpsd.pid, pmtdiefaced.pid) 
	==> /run  (NO NEED TO INSTALL - FYI ONLY)
WMM.COF (World Magnetic Model data) ==> /usr/share/pmt/WMM.COF
calibration data (generated via calib1.c, calib2.c) ==> /usr/share/pmt/calibdata
FreeSans.ttf ==> /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf  (for SDL2 only)

# INSTALLATION AND TESTING EXAMPLE for pmtfxosd
------------------------------------------------
# sudo cp S60pmtfxosd /etc/init.d/   	## where all daemon scripts stored
# sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd -v  ##S60 = automatically start on boot
# sudo cp pmtfxosd  /usr/sbin/      ## where all daemons are stored
#
#  /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd start  <==> service S60pmtfxosd start
#  service S60pmtfxosd restart  <==>  /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd restart   	
#  service S60pmtfxosd stop    		 
#  service --status-all       
#  ps -ef | grep pmt



*****************************************************************
**************** Running/debugging Daemons ******************


RUNNING  DAEMONS (X86 OR ARM)
----------------------------------
sudo service S50pmtgpsd start
sudo service S60pmtfxosd start
sudo service S70pmtdiefaced start
sudo ./viewsensorX86   OR ./viewsensorARM

NOTE
sudo service S60pmtfxosd start  <==>   sudo /etc/init.d/S60pmtfxosd start 

DEBUGGING
ps -ef | grep pmt
cat /var/log/syslog | tail
cat /run/pmtfxosd.pid
ls /dev/shm/pmt*  (pmtgps, pmtfxos, pmtdieface)

STOPPING FAKE DAEMONS (X86 OR ARM)
----------------------------------
sudo service S70pmtdiefaced stop
sudo service S60pmtfxosd stop    		 
sudo service S50pmtgpsd stop
Daemons must be started and stopped properly to prevent a crash
 - see RECOVERY FROM A CRASH - 

************************* RECOVERY FROM A CRASH ************************
ps -ef | grep pmt ==> get list of active pmt daemons and kill -9 them
ls /run/pmt*  ==> get list of pmt-.pid files and delete them 
ls /dev/shm/pmt* ==> get list of share-memory files and delete them 



*****************************************************************
**************** Daemon Removal from Computer ******************

### Don't forget to remove from /etc/init.d/ /usr/sbin/ for daemon removal ######
#  /etc/init.d/S50pmtgpsd, S60pmtfxosd, S70pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/sbin/pmtgpsd, pmtfxosd, pmtdiefaced
#  /usr/share/pmt/WMM.COF, calibdata
#  /run/pmtgpsd.pid, pmtfxosd.pid,  pmtdiefaced.pid 


*****************************************************************
**************** Compiliation (Makefile) explained ******************
We are using Linaro downloaded via Ubuntu, + libraries from Buildroot (because Ubuntu Linaro for some reason does not have -li2c + header files from Ubuntu Linaro. 
NOTE that PATH is unchanged because we do NOT use Buildroot compiler (because it has a toolchain-wrapper and doesn't work for some reason)
